# Sophie's Garden :cherry_blossom:

Sophie's Garden is a bottle python web server running on a raspberry pi in my kitchen. It is connected to a webcam and is scheduled to take a picture every 30 minutes of some herbs that we hope to grow! The last 10 pictures are shown on the home page.

Long term, the plan is to create a time lapse video of the herbs as they grow. The web site was just for a bit of fun.
